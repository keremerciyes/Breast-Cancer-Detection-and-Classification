# Breast Cancer Detection Project

## Overview
This project aims to develop a web application capable of segmenting and classifying tumors in ultrasound data, enabling the identification of malignant or benign tumors in patients. The application uses machine learning models for classification and a U-Net model for segmentation.

## Team
- Ye≈üim Tortop
- Mustafa Soydan
- Kerem Erciyes

## Supervisor
- Prof. Dr. Isabella Castiglioni

## Project Structure
The project includes several components:
- **User Interfaces**: Implemented using Streamlit for easy navigation and interaction.
- **Classification Models**: SVM, Random Forest (RF), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). The MLP model was selected as the best model.
- **Segmentation Model**: U-Net model for image segmentation.

## User Interface Files
1. **main.py**:
    - The main entry point of the application.
    - Manages navigation between different pages (Login, Home, Radiology).

2. **login.py**:
    - Handles the login functionality.
    - Simple hardcoded login credentials for demonstration purposes.

3. **home.py**:
    - Home page after successful login.
    - Displays patient data and allows navigation to the Radiology page.

4. **radiology.py**:
    - Main page for radiology functionalities.
    - Allows uploading radiological images, performs segmentation using U-Net, extracts features using Pyradiomics, and classifies the image as benign or malignant using the MLP model.

## Models and Scripts
1. **feature_extraction_RF_MLP(NN).ipynb**:
    - Notebook for feature extraction and training the RF and MLP models.

2. **UNet_segmantation.ipynb**:
    - Notebook for training and saving the U-Net segmentation model.

3. **SVM_balanced_data.ipynb**:
    - Notebook for training the SVM model with balanced data.

## Model Selection
- **Classification**: After experimenting with SVM, RF, and MLP, the MLP model was selected for its superior performance.
- **Segmentation**: The U-Net model was chosen for its effectiveness in biomedical image segmentation.

## Usage
1. **Login**: Use the login interface to access the application.
2. **Home Page**: View and manage patient data. Navigate to the Radiology page.
3. **Radiology Page**: Upload a radiological image. The image is processed through the following steps:
    - **Segmentation**: The U-Net model segments the image.
    - **Feature Extraction**: Extract features using Pyradiomics.
    - **Classification**: The MLP model classifies the tumor as benign or malignant.

## Ethical Considerations
- Adheres to GDPR and national guidelines.
- Ensures data minimization, anonymization, and data security.
- Informed consent and transparent outputs are prioritized.

## Conclusion
The project provides a reliable and ethically sound method for diagnosing breast health from ultrasound data. The use of AI in tumor detection and classification aids in early diagnosis and monitoring.
